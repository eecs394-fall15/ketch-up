# Ketch Up

Bugs (yes, I know there's an issues page on GitHub):
* Form validation accepts negative numbers
* "Add" button "jumps" around when I navigate friends/coworker/family
* Information is successfully updated when user calls contact, but the page isn't immediately updated (they have to go to another screen and go back for it to update).
